[11/19/22, 3:32:35 PM] ~ Ananth: Dudes literally have witch curses on each other to be best player on pitch
[11/19/22, 3:47:48 PM] ~ Kali Cell: I had posted this analysis in a different WA group few days ago. Thought of sharing with this group.

- Brazil team is super strong (in all areas - front line, midfield, defense & keeping). But many times very strong teams lose out in knockout stages (recent example - India in T20 WC)

- Argentina team is good but not as strong as Brazil. They have an emotional factor in Messi. They may do well like they did under Maradona in Italia-90 when they reached the finals. But I am not sure if they can win the cup.

- Uruguay has a strong team but…

The important factor is that Latin America has not won the WC for 20 years now. So this generation of player will make a strong pitch.

In the Europe,
- No doubt England has a very strong team. But most desi don’t want England to win (like you did not support them in the recent T20 WC)

- France has a decent team (very strong front line but weak midfield). Expecting them to win again within 4 years is un-French-like (too lazy a country for a consecutive WC).

- Germany has a young and energetic team but may go up to quarter finals at max

- Belgium has very talented individual players but may not be as effective as a team

- Holland looks strong on paper but they have never done it before. May emerge as dark horse.

- Portugal has a very strong team and I like them. But I will not bet my dollar on them.

- Spain could be another dark horse but I personally do not like Spanish style of football.

- Serbia - A team worth cheering for. They will not let you down.

- Other teams worth watching for are Senegal, Poland & Switzerland

- I have high hopes on both Korea and Japan as well.

- I would have liked Italy to win. But they decided to skip this World Cup.

Best team so far in technic and tactics, in my opinion. Enrique ball❤️
[11/23/22, 10:45:58 AM] ~ Prajwal: Yup! My 2nd choice after Argentina 😅 They’re looking really good. The squad is a perfect mix of youth and experience
[11/23/22, 10:48:27 AM] Smart Khawar UofU: Agreed, didn't really see anyone dominate like this yet

[11/23/22, 10:59:04 AM] ~ Ishaan Kapoor: I kind of feel like Spain got lucky as Costa Rica's tactics played right into the hands of Spain. I don't know how well it will work against a team with high pressing.
[11/23/22, 10:59:26 AM] ~ Alfonso: Costa Rica players are old 🥲
[11/23/22, 11:06:00 AM] ~ Prajwal: Well I think they can adapt, unlike Argentina yesterday. 
They have wide players like Almo and Torres on either wing who can bend their run and beat the offside trap. You can also throw in Ansu Fati to the mix. 
And of course you have Pedri and Busquets control in midfield and the ability to pick out the players. 
Their biggest problem is probably going to be a proper out and out striker/ goal scorer. They can be found out in tight games.
[11/23/22, 11:07:42 AM] ~ Ishaan Kapoor: Fair enough. Let's see how things shape up. I am kind of excited to see how Hazard fairs for Belgium though. Would be interesting.
[11/23/22, 11:09:28 AM] Smart Khawar UofU: Personally excited for Alphonso Davies
[11/23/22, 11:34:20 AM] ~ Kali Cell: Navas’ performance was very poor. He committed many mistakes. At least two goals are due to his mistake.
[11/23/22, 12:08:02 PM] ~ Prajwal: Yes he had a poor game

[12/13/22, 12:34:59 PM] ~ Praneeth: But it didn't look like penalty
[12/13/22, 12:39:19 PM] ~ Akshay: What a run
[12/13/22, 12:39:48 PM] Nikhil (Amazon): It was an absolute penalty
[12/13/22, 12:40:50 PM] ~ Ananth: It's a pen
[12/13/22, 12:40:59 PM] ~ Ananth: But not Livakovic's fault
[12/13/22, 12:41:20 PM] ~ Ananth: The moment he went through 1v1 it was either goal or pen tbh
[12/13/22, 12:45:21 PM] ~ Praneeth: Hmm. It didn't look like it was goalkeepers fault, but I missed the earlier sequence of actions
[12/13/22, 12:46:46 PM] ~ Ananth: Goalkeeper needs to make himself as big as possible to save
[12/13/22, 12:47:18 PM] ~ Ananth: Rules state that as long as you get the ball past him, if you go down from contact with gk, you get pen
[12/13/22, 12:47:22 PM] ~ Ananth: It's pretty clear
[12/13/22, 12:48:03 PM] ~ Ananth: It's just unfortunate that gk needs to make himself vulnerable with you giving away pen once you make yourself that big

[12/28/22, 6:08:42 PM] ~ Kali Cell: I am returning from India next week. We will have a grand prize ceremony in the next game.

I am just wondering what could be an appropriate prize given that there are 6 winners. How about getting few new soccer balls for our team?? That way we don’t have to go for a lucky draw among the correct entries to pick one winner for the prize.

Ideas welcome (but not binding)…
[12/28/22, 6:10:05 PM] ~ Ananth: How about asking them to get us the balls.

Their team won, they are more happy than us. They should share it 😛

[2/3/23, 12:09:32 PM] ~ Ishaan Kapoor: Game on.
[2/3/23, 12:42:13 PM] Maitrey Mehta (UofU): Good to see a lot of new people! Just a few things to keep in mind:
1. Cleats/Studs are okay but not mandatory.
2. No sliding tackles during the game
3. We play with last men (and not keepers)...and the last men are rotated every 5-10 mins...so everyone might have to be one at some point in the game
[2/3/23, 12:43:21 PM] ~ Saurabh Saxena: 4. You can fight with your own teammates as well
[2/3/23, 12:44:24 PM] ~ Aniket: 5. People who are not in Utah can leave the group 😜

[3/26/23, 12:47:05 PM] ~ David Teng: Snowfall has stopped here near the UU.  The clouds are clearing and, looking west, there are patches of blue sky and some sunshine across the valley.  If the snow on the turf field melts, we could play.

FYI, the RH field was completely clear yesterday and three groups were playing futbol around 4-6 PM.
[3/26/23, 12:49:33 PM] ~ Ananth: Great
[3/26/23, 12:49:41 PM] ~ Ananth: Thanks

[3/26/23, 12:56:17 PM] ~ Ananth: Yes. Fresh snow should be easier to clear
[3/26/23, 12:56:26 PM] ~ Ananth: I'll get shovels and be there a bit earlier

[5/15/23, 10:20:55 AM] Asen UofU (Lucid): Short lecture: we are all desi people here. And we all love to reach exactly when the last person is reaching. I’m sure you can imagine the dilemma that creates. So basically if anyone is getting late. Dm a couple of timely people. Don’t write on the group pls. It creates a bandwagon effect. And just try to be on time in general. Thanks!
[5/15/23, 10:25:36 AM] ~ Ishaan Kapoor: @18014103588 he means you.
[5/15/23, 10:26:34 AM] Asen UofU (Lucid): Perfect example.
[5/15/23, 10:32:46 AM] ~ Ananth: Perfect
[5/15/23, 10:34:07 AM] ~ Ananth: So, if we are having the game tomorrow, would really appreciate if we could get the full game started at worst by 7.

That leaves 15 minutes for setting up and warmup

We also can do pickups and drops as long as you are reasonably along the path of anyone driving to the ground

I'm new here so wanted to know if it like a turf with 5v5 or do we play in the whole field with 9-11 players ?
[8/20/23, 2:20:24 PM] ~ Praneeth: It's an artificial turf, preferably 6 v 6 or 7 v 7
[8/20/23, 2:20:33 PM] ~ Praneeth: Depending on number of people
[8/20/23, 2:25:07 PM] ~ Ananth: We don't impose an upper limit on number of players, but people naturally are reluctant to add their names once the count crosses 17/18
[8/20/23, 2:25:34 PM] ~ Ananth: But yes, ideally we plan on having either a 7v7 or 8v8, but we play at a minimum of 5v5

Hi ! 
We frequently play football/soccer at the Rowland Hall High School grounds:

https://maps.google.com/?cid=18083415545554735037&entry=gps

 Everytime we are interested in playing, we start a list and keep adding players as they keep confirming that they can play.

We usually play around twice a week.

We also can do pickups and drops as long as you are reasonably along the path of anyone driving to the ground. It's FREE

I’d recommend you guys try for a game on Friday evenings and Sunday evenings. 
Rowland is typically free on both these days.
That way you can try and have at least 2 games per week in Rowland until daylight saving ends on November 5th. 
That’s what we would do back in the day.

where is the venue?
what kind of turf do we play on (natural or artificial grass)?
futsal or football?
indoor or outdoor?
[11/2/23, 12:39:34 PM] Pratik Kharade (UofU): https://maps.app.goo.gl/roR9L2y15Bx3H1i68

Rowland Hall is the preferred ground. If this one is occupied, there are 2-3 grounds right next to it. 
This one is turf. 1 other is also turf. Other 2 are grass
Football
all outdoors

It is with immeasurable sadness that I am conveying the passing of Collin Teng, my son.  He lost his life at the young age of 24 in a bicycle accident.  He was the brightest light in our family, sharing positivity and joy with everyone.  One of his greatest joys throughout his life was playing jogo bonito, the beautiful game, especially with friends like you.

Wendy (mom, my wife), Evan (his brother) and I dearly love Collin and will greatly miss him.

[11/12/23, 2:16:28 PM] ~ Sukrut: Injured
[11/14/23, 9:46:01 AM] ~ Ola: Good morning all....are we playing tomorrow?
[11/14/23, 9:46:52 AM] ~ Ananth: Is it a holiday?
[11/14/23, 9:47:45 AM] ~ Ananth: We usually don't start list for weekdays because we would have to start playing before 4pm, and officegoers cannot do that time
[11/14/23, 9:48:03 AM] ~ Ananth: But you can try starting a list, and see how many people join
[11/14/23, 10:15:51 AM] ~ Ola: I was going to suggest that we do Wednesdays (5pm) and either Fridays (3pm) or Saturdays (10am or 3pm) ...with that, we will have the fitness spread through the week, enough time to recover and have time for weekend hangout/hangover.... all of this is subject to our availability and weather
[11/14/23, 10:16:40 AM] ~ Ola: Thanks for the heads-up...and pardon my ignorance...didnt know we dont do weekdays....I ll leave it for the weekend...maintain the staus-quo
[11/14/23, 10:17:21 AM] ~ Ananth: No ola you're good
[11/14/23, 10:17:27 AM] ~ Ananth: Just that sun sets at 5
[11/14/23, 10:17:31 AM] ~ Ananth: Which is the main problem
[11/14/23, 10:17:36 AM] ~ Ananth: Another option is indoor
[11/14/23, 10:18:24 AM] ~ Ananth: We can play indoor football in the university after 6, if enough people are interested
[11/14/23, 10:19:07 AM] ~ Ananth: Rowland has no floodlights we can use
[11/14/23, 10:33:45 AM] ~ Ola: You are a star! Playing indoor at the U is a good idea.

[2/20/24, 8:54:59 PM] Maitrey Mehta (UofU): Hi Everyone,

We tragically lost a fellow Rowland footballer, Collin, a few months back. Collin was an amazing person and an absolute joy to play with. David (Collin's father) and his family are setting up a pre-nursing scholarship at the Salt Lake Community College in his memory. It would be an amazing tribute to Collin if we could help them raise funds for the scholarship. 

You can donate through the SLCC donation website by scanning the QR code in the attached flyer. Or if you cannot access the website, you can Venmo David at @David-Teng-14 and he'll forward it to the scholarship. Appreciate any help. After all, Collin was one of us!

Best,
Maitrey

[5/14/24, 11:32:44 PM] ~ Rajit: Off topic ...Has anyone taken insurance for visiting parents and has had positive experience? I understand all of them will only cover for a new condition and very few, depending on the policy, will only cover an acute onset of a pre existing condition. Is it even worth taking an insurance considering an emergency? Perhaps flying out to NYC  for a complex condition is more practical expensewise. 

Appreciate your thoughts in advance. ‎<This message was edited>
[5/14/24, 11:48:42 PM] ~ aleriagr: How long are they visiting? My parents bought a travelling insurance for 3 weeks and it was enough. Nothing happened though
[5/14/24, 11:56:46 PM] ~ Rajit: 5 months
[5/14/24, 11:59:40 PM] ~ Rajit: Do you know anyone who was benifitted from the insurance?...I read mostly negatives on the web...
[5/15/24, 7:13:17 AM] ~ aleriagr: Hmm, that's a long time. The inauranxlce that my parents contracted was from a Spanish company in Spain.. not sure if you ahould check an american company or one from your home country for such a long time
[5/15/24, 9:34:25 AM] ~ Joseph Nishanth J: insubuy.com
[5/15/24, 11:16:29 AM] ~ Rajit: I have checked insbuy...but all of them do not cover pre existing conditions and preventive   care
[5/16/24, 2:50:03 AM] ~ Rajit: Does anybody have any experience in getting Utah Medicad (State provided health insurance) for visiting parents? (I know for a fact that in some states visiting parents are able to attain a state provided health insurance based on being in the low income/very low income group.)

[6/3/24, 1:12:47 PM] ~ Juli Zylyftari: Also guys it would be easier if you just did a poll so that you would just have to press a button instead of copy/ pasting everyone’s names 😂
[6/3/24, 1:13:18 PM] ~ Juli Zylyftari: ‎POLL:
Game on Tuesday at 6pm
‎OPTION: Coming (5 votes)
‎OPTION: Can’t make it (0 votes)
[6/3/24, 1:13:25 PM] ~ Juli Zylyftari: Something like that haha
[6/3/24, 1:44:00 PM] Maitrey Mehta (UofU): Appreciate the suggestion. A couple of reasons why we do the list:
1. When a lot of people show up, we use the list to make balanced teams. So it's easier to copy the list. Also, we don't have everyone's number saved so it is difficult to know who the person is corresponding to number (you'll be surprised by how many ppl keep the display name that is not their actual name)
2. You can't add any pluses for the people you'll be getting along with you who are not in the group.
3. Some people rely on some others for a ride to the ground. Any last minute changes can alter their plans to reach the ground. It's unfortunately hard to track whether someone has cancelled last minute in a poll whereas an explicit update notifies everyone regarding the update (and they can be shamed accordingly, jk)
4. Polls can get lost if there is a longer conversation after the poll was posted. You can def pin though.
These are all, of course, excuses for our reluctance to change. One day we'll convince ourselves to embrace better tech 😂
[6/3/24, 1:45:34 PM] ~ Ananth: Also polls mean no skin in the game

It doesn't take a lot of effort and visibility for someone to keep changing across votes and just screw with the count in general

[8/13/24, 11:13:04 AM] ~ Ola: Amongst ourselves, I think .... or should I say I prefer. 
The truth is that we need time together to smoothen our "rough edges" if we truly want to defeat any formidable opponents. While I like the idea that we are playing against other teams, may I suggest we limit the frequency ... maybe to once every fortnight or every week, at the very least. Between these periods, we play amongst ourselves and hone our strengths...this will also allow us to select a "solid" first team + reliable substitutes + enjoy ourselves. This is just an opinion!

[9/10/24, 8:48:37 PM] ~ Ishaan Kapoor: Orange as a fruit is not English so don't call it an "English fruit"

Actually earliest records of oranges are found in South China and North East India so technically what you mean to say is, 

"It's an African word for the Indo-Chinese fruit santra. Interestingly the African spelling and the English spelling of the fruit is very similar. (Which could be because  the Britishers brought the fruit to Africa during colonisation or vice versa)."

Thank you for attending my Ted talk titled...

That way we have more light to play and it usually takes us a while to get going.

[10/14/24, 4:18:14 PM] ~ aleriagr: It's 3 dollars per hour and they stop checking from 18:30 aprox
[10/14/24, 4:21:11 PM] ~ Aditya Bhowmik: I doubt he's looking at it from a monetary perspective
[10/14/24, 4:56:22 PM] ~ Aniket: Yeah pay and park options are limited and usually most of the parking is reserved for U or A permit
[10/14/24, 4:56:47 PM] ~ Aniket: I don’t mind taking public transport if we can get the field tbh

[10/20/24, 8:58:49 AM] ~ Rahul Reddy Ala: Guys, I am sorry. I totally forgot that the goals and balls are with me. I came to my cousin's place in Saratoga. Sorry again.🙏🏼
[10/20/24, 11:52:07 AM] ~ Juli Zylyftari: Guys we are playing against another team here and I think this is too many people. We can ofc play with subs but up to you. I think the first 11 people that show up can get priority and whoever comes late can be a sub.
[10/20/24, 12:09:32 PM] Maitrey Mehta (UofU): I'm happy to pull out..can use the time to work...just a note for the future that now that the sun is setting early and weekday games are unlikely, most of the people will show up on the weekends. So, it'd better if we play amongst ourselves so that everyone gets a chance to play. Enjoy the game today!
[10/20/24, 12:33:54 PM] ~ Ola: @18019070845 , dont pull out....please come and lets have fun....some of us can set up play aside and enjoy ourselves too while the game is going on.
[10/20/24, 1:04:35 PM] ~ Nithin Shetty: If we have enough space on the ground,
The remaining players can do a 5v5 with smaller goals on the other side plus the possibility of getting few more folks on the ground who wouldn’t put their names here on this group
[10/20/24, 1:38:27 PM] Maitrey Mehta (UofU): Hey man, I'll see. It's just been a busy semester. If you are planning on the smaller game, just figure if you can get the small goals on the ground and a ball from somewhere since Rahul is away
[10/20/24, 2:11:42 PM] ~ Rahul Reddy Ala: Sorry again
[10/20/24, 2:11:51 PM] ~ Rahul Reddy Ala: Ishaan does have a ball
[10/20/24, 2:16:54 PM] ~ aleriagr: Guys when we play against the other team, just mention it
[10/20/24, 2:17:24 PM] ~ aleriagr: Are you planning to play with the big goals today then?
[10/20/24, 3:11:11 PM] ~ Caleb S: I forgive you

[10/30/24, 3:34:53 PM] ~ Hamza: Hey all, my friend’s father in Lebanon had a cardiac emergency (Aortic Aneurysm) and will need an open heart surgery for direct repair. He’s not insured and it costs $22,500. I’m reaching out to friends to help him out. If you’d like and can help out I’d really appreciate if you can Venmo me @hamzalsh.  They’re doing the surgery this Friday and he needs at least half the money by then for the hospital to do it. I’ll be sending the money to him on Friday morning. Anything helps :)

[11/23/24, 11:48:45 AM] Smart Khawar UofU: I am convinced the only difference between city and United this whole time was rodri
[11/23/24, 12:01:07 PM] Maitrey Mehta (UofU): Tell me you are a United fan without telling me you are a United fan 😂
[11/23/24, 12:07:25 PM] Smart Khawar UofU: Losing 3-0 to spurs while being on a 4 game winless streak is something I'd expect from United.

I think I make a reasonable assumption seeing that City went on this run right as Rodri got injured.
[11/23/24, 12:24:52 PM] ~ Sukrut: Can someone pick me up from palladio?

So, we won't have them until Saturday. If someone has a ball and we are okay playing with makeshift goals, we can work it out this one time. Sorry again!

[4/12/25, 10:40:48 PM] ~ Ola: Thanks for your chat, David,...I was actually drafting this message for us:
_Hey Team...Let’s Keep the Game Fun & Respectful ⚽,  
I’ve noticed tensions running a bit high lately—passion for the game is great, but let’s remember we’re all here to have fun, stay active, and enjoy each other’s company. A little competitiveness is part of the sport, but we’re adults first and teammates always.  

A quick reminder:  
✅ *Keep it friendly*—no insults, no grudges.  
✅ *Respect calls* (even the questionable ones 😉).  
✅ *Diffuse heated moments*—take a breath, laugh it off.  

We’re accountable to each other, and I trust we can keep the vibe positive. If anyone’s feeling frustrated, just tap out for a sub and reset. Let’s focus on the love of the game and the camaraderie!  
See you all at the next match—ready to play hard but fair._

[5/9/25, 7:53:35 AM] ~ Unc: Except Nils cuz he has 3 hearts and 4 lungs
[5/9/25, 8:35:33 AM] ~ Unc: I'll bring my cooler and we can take turns getting ice from 7 11. It's like 2 bucks for a bag

Just bring your own water/electrolytes and we can all have cold water to drink during and after the games
[5/9/25, 8:36:58 AM] ~ Unc: But can we do 2/2:30pm?
[5/9/25, 8:56:11 AM] ~ Juli Zylyftari: How about 1pm? Because if we write that most people will show up at 2pm anyway.
[5/9/25, 9:23:16 AM] ~ Prajwal: Hi guys. I used to be a regular till a couple of years back. 
I’ll be in town on Saturday and thought of playing a game. 
I’m going to start a list for Saturday at 7.30AM since that time that works best for me and it’s probably the most pleasant time to play considering Saturday temperatures.
Whoever can make it, feel free to add your name to the list.

[5/11/25, 9:14:16 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: First goal was offside too
[5/11/25, 9:22:24 AM] ~ Ola: @Ezekiel Fatomilola ....how are we doing?
[5/11/25, 9:25:59 AM] ~ aleriagr: they're 4-2 half time? 😱😱
[5/11/25, 9:27:17 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: Yup
[5/11/25, 9:30:08 AM] ~ Ezekiel Fatomilola: Ferran wanted to give me heart attack🤣🤣🤣
[5/11/25, 9:37:32 AM] ~ Eze Mike Eze: For your mind😂😂😂
[5/11/25, 9:37:56 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: I dont like ferran but he has been great today

[5/11/25, 10:03:02 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: went to cameras and still didnt give it. Wow
[5/11/25, 10:04:51 AM] ~ Prajwal: Just unbelievable. Daylight robbery.
[5/11/25, 10:06:06 AM] ~ Ezekiel Fatomilola: You wonder how they have 15 UCLs that’s a classic example.
[5/11/25, 10:06:26 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: If there was a var back then that 15 ucl would be 8-9
[5/11/25, 10:15:35 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: Ball dont lie, congrats to barca for the championship
[5/11/25, 10:17:07 AM] ~ Ezekiel Fatomilola: Referee to Madrid rescue again🤣🤣🤣
[5/11/25, 10:19:25 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: Damn dude so
Fucking blatant
[5/11/25, 10:21:57 AM] ~ Ezekiel Fatomilola: The Tchouameni’s handball was blatant too, isn’t it? Let’s pretend the referee was fair.
[5/11/25, 10:26:45 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: You got me wrong, it wasnt a faul 😁
[5/11/25, 10:26:53 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: Ref has been horrible
[5/11/25, 10:28:58 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: Ref helping real was blatant
[5/11/25, 10:30:23 AM] ~ Ola: I thought the officiating wasn’t balanced …if Tchoumeni’s handball isn’t given, Femini’s shouldn’t ‎<This message was edited>
[5/11/25, 10:30:59 AM] ~ Ugur Serinturk: Reals first goal was a clear offside
